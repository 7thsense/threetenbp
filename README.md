ThreeTen backport project
=========================

JSR-310 provides a new date and time library for JDK 1.8.
This project is the backport to JDK 1.7.

The backport is NOT an implementation of JSR-310, as that would require
jumping through lots of unecessary hoops.
Instead, this is a simple backport intended to allow users to quickly
use the JSR-310 API on JDK 1.7.

Active development on JSR-310 is at [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/threeten/):

This GitHub repository includes code developed as part of creating JSR-310.
Technically, all the contributions were to the ThreeTen reference implementation
under the BSD license. As such, this fork is perfectly legally sound.
