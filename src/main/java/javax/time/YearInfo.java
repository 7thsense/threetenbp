     * <p>
     * This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line.
     * In general, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without
     * remainder. However, years divisible by 100, are not leap years, with
     * the exception of years divisible by 400 which are.
     * <p>
     * For example, 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4.
     * 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100, however 2000 was a
     * leap year as it is divisible by 400.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past.
     * This is historically inaccurate, but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard.
     *
