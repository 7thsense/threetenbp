TimeScale implementations.

<h2>Converting between Instant and DateTime</h2>
<p>To convert an Instant to a DateTime based on a TimeScale, use TimeScale.getTimeScaleInstant().
TimeScaleInstant.getSimpleEpochSeconds(), TimeScaleInstant.getNanoOfSecond() should then be adjusted for
TimeZone and daylight saving. Now convert the resulting seconds to the required calendar. Finally,
add TimeScaleInstant.getLeapSecond() to the second field.</p>
<p>The reverse conversion starts by taking any excess seconds over 59 as 'leapSecond'. Convert the remainder
    and create a TimeScaleInstant using TimeScaleInstant.leapInstant(). Then TimeScale.instant(TimeScaleInstant tsi)
will create the required instant.</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<p>The javax.time.Instant class records time on the TAI time scale. This reflects the real situation in that other
time scales are either defined relative to TAI or the difference to TAI is reported. TAI has the advantage of being a continuous
time scale with a uniform rate (all seconds are the same length). This choice allows Duration
computations to be performed simply with units of plain SI seconds.</p>

<p>However TAI is not well known, and in IT it is more common to use some variant of UTC. This introduces a number
    of problems.
    <ul>
        <li>Between 1961 and 1972 UTC used seconds that were both variable and slightly different to an SI second. There
        were also both positive and negative leaps (discontinuities) of either 50ms or 100ms. There was a final
        discontinuity of 0.107758s at 1972-01-01.</li>
        <li>After 1972, leap seconds have been introduced at regular intervals. These are more visible to date/time
            applications especially as 2008-12-31T23:59:60 is a valid time which is one second before
            2009-01-01T00:00:00. Unfortunately it has become common practice to pretend that such times do not exist, or
            to adjust for them in a variety of rather odd ways (such as stretching the 1000 preceding seconds).
        </li>
    </ul>
    It would be possible to add extra fields to javax.time.Instant to allow it to represent some variant of UTC, but
    this would considerably complicate Duration. (The extra fields are required to resolve the ambiguities.)
