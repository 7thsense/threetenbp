<p>
ThreeTen-Backport provides a backport of the JDK 8 date-time classes to JDK 7.
</p>
<p>
JSR-310 provides a new date and time library for JDK 8.
This project is the backport to JDK 7.
</p>
<p>
The backport is NOT an implementation of JSR-310, as that would require
jumping through lots of unnecessary hoops.
Instead, this is a simple backport intended to allow users to quickly
use the JSR-310 API on JDK 7.
The backport should be referred to using the "ThreeTen" name.

<p>
There are no full releases yet!
Release 0.8.1 is the current development release intended for feedback.
The code is fully tested, but there may yet be bugs and the API may yet change.
There should be no great reason why it cannot be used in production if you can cope with future API change.
</p>
<p>
The project runs on JDK 8 and has no dependencies.
</p>
<p>
Available in <a href="http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|org.threeten|threetenbp|0.8.1|jar">Maven Central</a>.
