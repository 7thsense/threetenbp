Performance testing of alternative duration implementations

Each test is executed by running the main method in the factory class:

javax.time.DurationFactory
javax.time.ExtendedDurationFactory
javax.time.BigDurationFactory
javax.time.BigIntegerDurationFactory
javax.time.MillisDurationFactory
javax.time.UnsafeMillisDurationFactory
javax.time.DoubleDurationFactory
