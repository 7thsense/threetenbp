Design
This branch uses a more radical approach than previous strategy branches.
The new code is in the builder package (old code not deleted).
The design defines a set of standard fields that are available in all calendar systems.
These fields and units can only be used when linked to the chronology.
Overall, its a descriptive rather than a prescriptive approach.
There is also a separation between the field and rules implementing the field.
The principal objects being worked on are LocalDate/LocalTime/LocalDateTime.

Problems
This is a big change with the use of LD/LT/LDT as the main objects.
The use of enums feels like a step forward and is more possible with Java 8 default interfaces.
However, the imposition of the chronology into the main flow of method calls is
an intrusion and an imposition for a relatively minor use case.

Next step
Take away the chronology from the main use case.
Treat the chronology linked fields as a binding of a neutral field to a chronology.
