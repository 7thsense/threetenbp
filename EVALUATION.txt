Design
This branch was a quick evaluation of whether DateResolver could be removed.

Problems
The alternative ways of doing resolving are not as pretty (and the one tried here fails).
That said, the number of methods removed on the main classes will probably justify the change.

Next step
Delete resolver in master (with no replacement initially).
