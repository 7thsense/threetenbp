Design
This branch provides general purpose long-long calculations between any two fields
focussed only on the derivation of children, not of parents.
Each conversion is registered.

Problems
This strategy doesn't leave anywhere for the epoch-days to be extracted from pyd
(as it only allows extraction of child from parent)
which means that some generic kind of convertToEpochDays() would be needed
which is more specific than the previous branch (pairstrategy), and not much less code

Next step
Try using a standard data format.
