Design
This branch uses a standard format of a long packed-date-time and an int nano-of-second.
All calculations are performed off the same standard fields.
Other fields are handled by checking if A is derivable from B.

Problems
This branch works well, but fails where you try to setDayOfYear() onto the format.
Setting the value requires the year to be known, but there is no simple way to know
if the year is known. For example, setting (doy = 278) will result in a different
month and dom depending on the year. The situation is worst with doy 366.

The problem is liable to be worse when dealing with other calendar systems.

Next step
Apply some kind of restriction to what can be derived from what.
