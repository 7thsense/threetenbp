Design
This branch provides general purpose long-long calculations between any two fields.
Each conversion is registered.

Problems
Chronologies like Historic, where the cutover date possibilities are semi-infinite
results in any registration based approach naturally leads to an unbound map
    
Culd only register concept calculation, with details like week-rules or historic cutover read
from passed in rule, but then how would you look up the calc in the map?
    
Pushes design back to just focusing on rules or chronologies
    
Same problem would apply to triple-based approach, rather than pair-based

Next step
Try only calculating children.
