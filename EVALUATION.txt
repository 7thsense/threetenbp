Design
This branch uses a standard format of a long packed-date and a long nano-of-day.
All calculations are performed off the same standard fields.
Other fields are handled by checking if A is derivable from B.

Problems
This branch works well, but suffers from the problem of being unable to define a DateTimeRule that
specifies a DateTime. As such, there is no rule to pass in that can be used for the A/B derivation check.

Next step
Try using long secs and int fraction.
