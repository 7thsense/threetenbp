</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>The public can read the names of the people on the Expert Group (ie, not just JCP Members)?</b>
</p><p>
The names of Expert Group members are listed on the JCP website, however some are listed only by company.
In practice, this question is moot, as the active group of experts is simply those participating in
the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=386712">primary mailing list</a>.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>The Expert Group business is regularly reported on a publicly readable alias? </b>
</p><p>
All business is conducted on the mailing list, with information about face-to-face meetings being forwarded.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>The schedule for the JSR is publicly available, it's current, and I update it regularly?</b>
</p><p>
JSR-310 will be included in Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 8 Release (JSR-337).
The schedule is Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 8 release schedule starting with the JavaTM SE 8 release Public Review.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>The public can read/write to a wiki for my JSR? </b>
</p><p>
  A public <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/threeten/index.php?title=ThreeTen">readable wiki</a>
  for the JSR exists. It is not publicly writable, discussion is encouraged at the mailing list instead.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>I have a discussion board for my JSR and I regularly read and respond to posts on that board? </b>
</p><p>
All discussion occurs on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=386712">primary mailing list</a>.
Spec leads regularly participate on the list.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>There is an issue-tracker for my JSR that the public can read? </b>
</p><p>
The <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/issues">primary issue tracker</a>, now located at GitHub, is fully read-write.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>I have spoken at conferences and events about my JSR recently? </b>
</p><p>
The JSR has been discussed at conferences numerous times over time.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>I am using open-source processes for the development of the RI and/or TCK? </b>
</p><p>
The JSR has been run along Open Source lines since the beginning.
The source code of the Reference Implementation and TCK has driven the specification.
The source code has always been available, first at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/threeten/">Sourceforge</a>
and now at <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten">GitHub</a>.
The project has evolved guided by a public mailing list.
</p>
<li><p>
<b>The Community tab for my JSR has links to and information about all public communication mechanisms and sites for the development of my JSR? </b>
  The community tab has the key link to the project <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/threeten/">home page</a>.
  The links in the transparency section are out of date.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
The following question from the v2.8 transparency checklist is also answered:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<b>What are the Terms of Use required to use the collaboration tools you have prepared to use with the Expert Group, so that prospective EG members can judge whether they are compatible with the JSPA? </b>
</p><p>
The source code is available under the <a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">BSD 3-clause license</a>.
Discussion contributions are freely accepted, however code contributions are accepted under the
<a href="https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten/blob/master/COPYRIGHT-ASSIGN.txt">JSR-310 Contributor Agreement</a>, based on the previous Sun Contributor Agreement.
</p>
</ul>

<h4>Question 5 - License terms</h4>
<p>
The Final Specification, Final RI, and Final Technology Compatibility Kit will be the Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 8 Release.
</p>
<p>
A separate forked project may continue the work of JSR-310 for earlier JDKs, however such a project would not be a JSR implementation.
</p>

<h4>Question 6 - Version number and Spec leads</h4>
<p>
The specification is version 0.7.
</p>
<p>
The release date is dependent on the Java<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> 8 Release.
