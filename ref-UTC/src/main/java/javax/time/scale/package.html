TimeScale implementations.

<h2>Converting between AbstractInstant and DateTime</h2>
<p>To convert any AbstractInstant to a DateTime, use the getSimpleEpochSeconds(), and getNanoOfSecond(). Adjust the
    seconds value for TimeZone and daylight saving. Convert to the required calendar. Finally adjust the seconds field
    by getLeapSecond() (always >= 0). The InstantFormat class illustrates this process for the proleptic
    Gregorian calendar and zero time zone offset.
</p>
<p>The reverse conversion starts by taking any excess seconds over 59 as 'leapSecond'. Convert the remainder
    and create an AbstractInstant using TimeScale.instant(long simpleEpochSecond, int nanoOfSecond, int leapSecond).</p>

<h2>Design Considerations</h2>
<p>
    The TimeScale on which javax.time.Instant is based can be changed simply by changing the Instant.SCALE field. When
    the choice of scale has been fixed, some optimisations may be possible.
